In this project, I have expanded my knowledge of Java by creating my own utility library 
to better adhere to the DRY principle. I created this library because I feel that Java 
lacks lots of convenient, built-in functions (especially compared to a language such as 
C#). I plan to build my utility library over the years as I become more proficient in 
this language, which I am really warming up to. 

I admittedly deviated from quite a few instructions from the lab manual, but I did so 
because I wish to avoid questionable design practices (most notably, using interfaces to 
gives constants to objects). I hope I can be granted some understanding in that regard. 
I also have few to no comments in my lab work because I think my code is extremely 
self-documenting, though I will definitely add proper Javadoc comments to my utility 
classes in the near future. I will also find a way to reduce the duplication of 
knowledge in my library by centralizing logic wherever possible. 

In case you have difficulty running my code, I have included the JAR file of my latest 
utility classes for your convenience. You can also access it on my GitHub. Thanks!
